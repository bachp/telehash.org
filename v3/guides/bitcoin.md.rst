Encrypted Peer Connections
--------------------------

High-level ideas on how to use telehash to encrypt connections to the
bitcoin network:

-  upon startup an endpoint should generate a new hashname to identify
   it to the network for that session
-  if an endpoint has prior/OOB context of the keys to a known ip/port,
   it should attempt an encrypted connection first, and fallback to a
   traditional tcp socket
-  when using a traditional tcp socket, an endpoint should embed its
   current hashname keys in base58 in its agent string
-  when receiving keys in a user agent string, a new encrypted
   connection should be attempted and replace the current one
-  TBD, add an encrypted bit to the advertised services so that its
   support is propogated
-  TBD, show how to use a channel to send/receive messages in parallel
   over a link

Hashname Pinning
----------------

When a hashname needs to be associated to a transaction it can be
included as an ``OP_RETURN`` output by generating a random 8-byte nonce
and processing the 32-byte hashname with the `ChaCha20
cipher <http://cr.yp.to/chacha.html>`__. The key input must be a common
or private shared value used by the parties generating the transaction
as well as validating it, as determined by the needs of the application.

The result is the 40 bytes for the ``OP_RETURN`` value, the 8-byte nonce
followed by the 32-byte encrypted hashname.

This transaction acts as a reference that can be independently validated
by anyone with the key input as a public lock to a single hashname.

Chain of Custody
----------------

The blockchain may be used in combination with telehash to form a chain
of custody from the bitcoin values/wallets to specific hashnames. This
is similar to pinning, but the hashnames in custody are always kept
private and never recorded in the blochain.

-  create an original genesis transaction that begins the chain of
   custody and serves as the parent fixture/reference id for all parties
-  every transaction has only two outputs, the refund output and the
   custody output
-  the custody output must be a P2SH with whatever associated value is
   relevant to the current chain

In order for any hashname to assert that it is in current custody of the
chain to another, it must create and sign a valid new transaction that
uses the most recent confirmed transaction's P2SH custody output as it's
input, and a single ``OP_RETURN`` output of the 32-byte hash of the
sender+recipient hashnames appended, with a ``0`` value associated so
that the transaction cannot be accidentially broadcast (note: what is a
better way to validate but prevent ever broadcasting?)

The recipient must fully validate the transaction, verify that the
input(s) are correct and output hash is correct, as well as the chain of
transaction input/outputs leads back to the shared genesis transaction.
