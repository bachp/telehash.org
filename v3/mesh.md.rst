Mesh Network
============

A mesh network consists of one or more links, which are active
`encrypted sessions <e3x/>`__ between two endpoints over any
`transport <transports/>`__. Each endpoint is identified with a unique
`hashname <hashname/>`__, the fingerprint of it's public key(s). A mesh
is private to each endpoint, which has complete control over what links
it accepts, there is no automatic sharing of any link state to any other
link.

The details for a link are often stored or exchanged in
`json <json.md.rst>`__ or as a `URI <uri.md.rst>`__, and the links are
established and maintained via `handshakes <e3x/handshake.md.rst>`__.

Once a link is up, `channels <channels/>`__ are used to run common
services over it:

-  peer: request connection to an endpoint from a router
-  connect: incoming connection request relayed
-  path: sync network transport info to try any direct/alternative paths
-  sock: tcp/udp socket tunneling
-  stream: binary streams
-  thtp: mapping/proxying of http requests/responses
-  ws: websocket api
-  chat: personal messaging
-  box: async/offline messaging

Mesh Structure
--------------

-  a mesh is a local hashname and links to one or more other hashnames
   (full mesh)
-  any link may be flagged as a ``router`` when it will provide
   relaying/bridging to other links
-  individual hashnames may have their own router defined
-  a router must have a way to validate hashnames before providing
   routing assistance to them
-  any hashname may advertise it's router as a path (and must provide
   routing to it for the first handshake)
-  a hashname my use a base `URI <uri.md.rst>`__ from a router as an
   out-of-band mechanism to establish new links

API
---

A simple API is documented here to help provide a consistent foundation
for all implementations by using similar methods/names and interaction
patterns:

``mesh = create(keypairs)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new mesh using the given keypairs (or generate new ones). This
should enable all transports and start handling incoming channels.

``mesh.onDiscover = function (from) {...}``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a new unknown hashname is discovered at any point (from transports
or a connect channel), all of the details (keys, hashname, paths) are
given to a callback or discovery event to be processed by the app.

``link = mesh.link(to)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Establish a link to the given hashname. The ``to`` may be a
`URI <uri.md.rst>`__, `JSON <json.md.rst>`__, or just a plain hashname.

``link.onLink = function (state) {...}``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the link state changes to up or down the app must be able to
receive these events, as well as check the current state at any point.

``link.router(bool)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set this link to be a default (trusted) router, which will automatically
ask it to assist in connections to any other link and provide assistance
in connecting to the local endpoint.

``mesh.discover(bool)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the local endpoint discovery mode to on or off, when on this will
tell any available transport to announce the endpoint's presence on
local networks and newly discovered endpoints will generate
``onDiscover`` events.

Built-in and Custom Channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All implementations should strive to support as many
`channels <channels/>`__ as possible directly off of ``mesh`` and
``link`` objects using the language and patterns described in each
channel definition. For example, the `stream <channels/stream.md.rst>`__
channel should be supported with a simple ``mesh.onStream`` event to
handle incoming requests and ``link.stream()`` to connect new streams
(using a language-native streaming interface if possible).

Custom channels should be avoided whenever possible by using one of the
built-in channels, and the API to create and handle custom channels is
implementation specific.

Discovery
---------

By default a local endpoint will never respond to any request unless it
comes from another endpoint it already knows and trusts. A ``discover``
mode can be enabled that changes this behavior and broadcasts the
endpoint's hashname and keys to any local `network
transport <transports/>`__ that supports discovery.

This mode should be used sparingly so that local networks cannot record
what endpoints are available, typically only enabled based on a user
behavior ("add a friend" or "pair device", etc) and only for a short
period of time. Permanent local services/servers that support dynamic
association may have it always enabled.

All transports that support discovery will always be listening for
incoming discover announcements regardless of the discovery state and
pass those to the application to evaluate. Discovery does not need to be
enabled to receive announcements and see other endpoints, only to
announce the local endpoint.
