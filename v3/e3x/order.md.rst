Endpoint Order
==============

In order to prevent conflicts between any two endpoints, uniqueness is
guaranteed by comparing the public keys of their agreed upon `cipher
set <README.md.rst>`__.

The binary value of each endpoint's public key is compared and they are
placed in high-to-low sorted order. To achieve this the two public keys
can be visited bit by bit, the first key that at a given position has a
``1`` (*higher*) where the other has a ``0`` (*lower*) is the one that
has *higher* order.

Based on this comparison the two are labeled as ``ODD`` (*high*)
endpoint and an ``EVEN`` (*low*) endpoint.

This mechanism ensures that that both endpoints will mutually agree on
their label consistently and without communication.
