Cipher Sets
===========

A Cipher Set (``CS``) is a group of crypto algrithms that are used to
implement the core security functions as required by e3x. Multiple sets
exist to allow an evolution of supporting newer techniques as well as
adapting to different system and deployment requirements.

A set always contains an endpoint public key cipher, an ephemeral public
key cipher (for forward secrecy), and an authenticated streaming cipher.
Often a set uses the same public key algorithm for both the endpoint and
epehemeral ciphers with different keys for each.

Each set is identified with a unique identifier (``CSID``) that
represents the overall selection priority. The ``CSID`` is a single
byte, represented in lower case hex. The ``CSIDs`` are always sorted
from lowest to highest preference.

+------------------------+----------+------------------------------------+------------------------+
| CSID                   | Status   | Crypto                             | Uses                   |

Two endpoints must always create exchanges to each other using the
highest common ``CSID`` between them. Apps may choose which one or more
``CSIDs`` they want to support when they create an endpoint and know
that a lower one will only ever be used to communicate with other
endpoints that only support that ``CS``.

Any ``CSID`` of ``0x0*`` (``0x01`` through ``0x0a``) are reserved for
special use custom Cipher Sets whose definitions are entirely
app-specific, the ``0x00`` ``CSID`` is not allowed and always considered
invalid.

Every ``CS`` requires a strong/secure random number generator in order
to minimally function, some of them may have additional entropy
requirements during endpoint key generation.

Exchanging CS Keys
------------------

Cipher Sets are designed to be combined together for use as
`hashnames <../../hashname/>`__ so that one local instance can
simultaneously use multiple ``CS``, always selecting the best one to use
based on what is available to another instance.

 ### JSON

When sharing ``CS`` keys in JSON always use
`base32 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-3.2>`__ encoding
(lower-case, no padding) of the binary public key value to create
strings that are safe to use everywhere.

One or more Cipher Set Keys are represented in a JSON object using the
``CSID`` hex string as the key with a base32 string ``VALUE``.

.. code:: json

    {
      "3a":"eg3fxjnjkz763cjfnhyabeftyf75m2s4gll3gvmuacegax5h6nia",
      "1a": "an7lbl5e6vk4ql6nblznjicn5rmf3lmzlm"
    }

 ### Packet (binary key)

Frequently the source for a hashname is being sent in a context where
there is a specific ``CSID`` already known or agreed upon and only that
single ``CS`` public key needs to be exchanged. This can be consistently
(and often more efficiently) encoded as a single
`packet <../../lob/>`__.

The packet's JSON header that only includes the 32-byte
``intermediate hash`` values of the other ``CSIDs`` as base32 encoded
strings, and the public key binary bytes of the active ``CSID`` in the
``BODY`` of the packet:

::

    HEAD:
    {
      "3a": "eg3fxjnjkz763cjfnhyabeftyf75m2s4gll3gvmuacegax5h6nia",
      "2a":true,
      "1a": "ckczcg2fq5hhaksfqgnm44xzheku6t7c4zksbd3dr4wffdvvem6q"
    }
    BODY: [2a's public key binary bytes]

When the context of which ``CSID`` is already known, that ``CSID``'s
``true`` value in the JSON is not required to identify which key is in
the ``BODY``.

 ### String

At times it is necessary to encode all of the ``CS`` key bytes to be
transferred Out-Of-Band in a simplified string context with minimal
special characters. To maximize compatibility between different
implementations, whenever possible a string encoding should mimic the
JSON format, including pairs of 2-character ``CSIDs`` with their base32
encoded key bytes. When minimizing the use of special characters, the
hex ``CSID`` may directly prefix the base32 string as it is always a
fixed length of 2, and the delimeter character can be any
non-alphanumeric that is available in the given context, such as ``.``,
``-``, ``,``, etc.

See `URI <../../uri.md.rst>`__ for an example of this style of mapping
to a query string:
