Cipher Set 1b
=============

    DRAFT - `Work In
    Progress <https://github.com/telehash/telehash.org/issues/42>`__

This is just a placeholder to define a hardware-accelerated friendly
embedded CS.

--------------

The base algorithms used in this set are chosen to be supported by
commonly available hardware-accelerated-crypto on embedded hardware.

-  **ECC NIST-P256**
-  **HMAC-SHA256**
-  **AES-128-CTR**
-  or `CCM <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCM_mode>`__ to replace CTR and
   HMAC? Contiki has started a `hardware-driver layer providing
   CCM <https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/pull/557>`__

    Inhereit from `CS1a <1a.md.rst>`__
