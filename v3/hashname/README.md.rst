Hashnames
=========

A ``hashname`` is a unique fingerprint to represent one or more public
keys of different formats, so that addressing and identity can be
consistent across multiple PKI systems. This enables a compatibility
layer for updating PKI in any application so that it can still represent
and verify itself to both existing and new instances.

The ``hashname`` is always a `base
32 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648>`__ encoded string that is 52
characters long, lower cased with `no
padding <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-3.2>`__. When
decoded it is alway a 32 byte binary value result of a
`SHA-256 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2>`__ hash. An example
hashname is ``uvabrvfqacyvgcu8kbrrmk9apjbvgvn2wjechqr3vf9c1zm3hv7g``.

In many ways, a ``hashname`` can be used as a portable secure `MAC
address <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address>`__, it is a globally
unique identifier for a network endpoint that is also self-generated and
cryptographically verifiable.

Implementations
---------------

-  `javascript <https://github.com/telehash/hashname>`__ (node and
   browserify)
-  `c <https://github.com/telehash/telehash-c/blob/master/src/lib/hashname.c>`__
-  `go <https://github.com/telehash/gogotelehash/tree/master/hashname>`__

Hashname Generation
-------------------

A hashname is calculated by combining the binary public key material of
one or more different `cryptographic
algorithms <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography>`__
through multiple rounds of
`SHA-256 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2>`__ hashing.

The generation has three distinct steps:

1. Each active key is mapped to a unique one-byte ``CSID`` based on its
   algorithm to provide consistent ordering
2. The binary key material for each ``CSID`` is hashed into intermediate
   digest values
3. An ordered roll-up hashing of the intermediate values generates the
   final 32-byte digest

Key CSIDs
~~~~~~~~~

Each public key included must have a unique single-byte ``CSID`` with a
byte array ``VALUE`` that is the consistent binary encoding of that
public key material for a given algorithm. Only one key can be used
per-algorithm to calculate a hashname.

The current public key ``CSID`` mappings and ``VALUE`` binary encodings
are defined in `Cipher Sets <../e3x/cs/>`__.

Any hashname generation software does not need to know or understand the
Cipher Sets or support the algorithms defined there, it only has to do
the consistent hashing of any given set of ``CSID`` and ``VALUE`` pair
inputs.

Intermediate Hashing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The binary byte array ``VALUE`` of each public key must first be hashed,
resulting in a 32 byte intermediate digest that is used in the rollup
calculation. These intermediate digests may be used by applications and
exchanged instead of the full keys when necessary.

Final Rollup
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To calculate the hashname the intermediate digests are sequentially
hashed in ascending order by their ``CSID``. Each one contributes two
values: the single byte ``CSID`` value and the 32 byte intermediate
digest value. The calculated hash is rolled up, wherein each resulting
32 byte binary output is concatenated with the next binary value as the
input. An example calculation would look like (in pseudo-code):

.. code:: js

    hash = sha256(0x1a)
    hash = sha256(hash + 0x21b65ba5a9567fed892569f00090b3c17fd66a5c32d7b355940088605fa7f350)
    hash = sha256(hash + 0x3a)
    hash = sha256(hash + 0x97d83d1af8919874a449769145b7b3cb46359b2c12169ee53e683477bec47101)
    final = hash

Here is a working example in node.js to do the calculation, results in
``27ywx5e5ylzxfzxrhptowvwntqrd3jhksyxrfkzi6jfn64d3lwxa``

.. code:: js

    var crypto = require("crypto");
    var base32 = require("rfc-3548-b32"); // https://github.com/sehrope/node-rfc-3548-b32
    var keys = {
      "3a":"eg3fxjnjkz763cjfnhyabeftyf75m2s4gll3gvmuacegax5h6nia",
      "1a": "an7lbl5e6vk4ql6nblznjicn5rmf3lmzlm"
    };
    var rollup = new Buffer(0);
    Object.keys(keys).sort().forEach(function(id){
      rollup = crypto.createHash("sha256").update(Buffer.concat([rollup,new Buffer(id,"hex")])).digest();
      var intermediate = crypto.createHash("sha256").update(new Buffer(base32.decode(keys[id]),"binary")).digest();
      rollup = crypto.createHash("sha256").update(Buffer.concat([rollup,intermediate])).digest();
    });
    var hashname = base32.encode(rollup).toLowerCase().split("=").join(""); // normalize to lower case and remove padding
    console.log(hashname); // prints 27ywx5e5ylzxfzxrhptowvwntqrd3jhksyxrfkzi6jfn64d3lwxa

Mapping/Addressing
------------------

When exchanging hashnames over existing IPv4/IPv6 based systems, the 4
or 16 byte prefix of the 32 byte hashname binary value is used to
provide a backward-compatible mechanism for addressing. It does not
guarantee uniqueness (which should be enforced outside of the IP-based
systems) but for many use-cases it can be a helpful connectivity
signalling tool.

When the IP space must be scoped into a reserved range and the port
number is also available to use, the first 2 bytes may be sent as the
port and then those 2 bytes in the address are hard-coded to a reserved
IP prefix.

A hashname may also be used as a normal MAC address with the prefix of
``42`` (has the locally-assigned bit set) and the first 5 bytes of the
hashname: ``42:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX``.
