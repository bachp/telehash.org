Links JSON Format
=================

Many apps use JSON as the storage/exchange format for links. This
definition is just the common patterns, implementations may support
additional keys/values.

Full example:

.. code:: js

      {
        "hashname": "frnfke2szyna2vwkge6eubxtnkj46rtctqk7g7ewbvfiesycbjdq",
        "admin": "http://telehash.org/"
        "keys": {
          "1a": "aiw4cwmhicwp4lfbsecbdwyr6ymx6xqsli"
        },
        "paths": [
          {
            "ip": "192.168.0.55",
            "port": 61407,
            "type": "udp4"
          },
          {
            "hn": "e5mwmtsvueumlqgo32j67kbyjjtk46demhj7b6iibnnq36fsylka",
            "type": "peer"
          }
        ]
      }

Only the ``hashname`` field is required, so that when stored in an array
each object can be uniquely identified.

Definitions:

-  ``hashname`` (required): The endpoint's hashname
-  ``admin``: A URL to identify the admin for the seed
-  ``keys``: The binary public keys for each cipher set in use, in
   base32
-  ``paths``: Array of path objects, as defined in
   `paths <channels/path.md.rst>`__.
