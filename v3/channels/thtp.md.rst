HTTP <> Telehash Bindings - thtp
================================

This is a channel mapping HTTP to telehash for the common browser
user-agent and web-app patterns. Most HTTP requests can be translated
directly into a ``thtp`` channel and back.

Packet
------

Any HTTP request/response is normalized into a packet by translating the
headers into the JSON and any contents attached as the binary BODY. The
headers are always lower-cased keys and string values, for requests the
``:method`` (upper case) and ``:path`` with string values are included,
and for responses the ``:status`` with the numeric value and optional
``:reason`` string value are included.

The request:

::

    GET / HTTP/1.1
    User-Agent: curl/7.30.0
    Accept: */*

Becomes:

.. code:: json

    {
      ":method":"GET",
      ":path":"/",
      "user-agent":"curl/7.30.0",
      "accept":"*/*",
    }

::

    BODY: empty

The response:

::

    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
    Server: nginx
    Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2014 21:33:14 GMT
    Content-Type: text/html
    Content-Length: 178
    Connection: keep-alive
    Location: http://www.fooooo.com/

    <html>
    <head><title>301 Moved Permanently</title></head>
    <body bgcolor="white">
    <center><h1>301 Moved Permanently</h1></center>
    <hr><center>nginx</center>
    </body>
    </html>

Becomes:

.. code:: json

    {
      ":status":301,
      ":reason":"Moved Permanently",
      "server":"nginx",
      "date":"Fri, 07 Mar 2014 21:12:39 GMT",
      "content-type":"text/html",
      "content-length":"178",
      "location":"http://www.fooooo.com/"
    }

::

    BODY:
    <html>
    <head><title>301 Moved Permanently</title></head>
    <body bgcolor="white">
    <center><h1>301 Moved Permanently</h1></center>
    <hr><center>nginx</center>
    </body>
    </html>

``thtp`` channel
----------------

A new request is initiated by creating a reliable channel of type
``thtp``, multiples can be created simultaneously. These channels are
always in one direction, the endpoint starting the channel can only send
a request packet over it, and the receiving side can only send a
response packet. If the receiving needs to make requests, it can start a
``thtp`` channel in the other direction at any point.

The channel open packet includes all of or as much of the request packet
as possible in the BODY, with subsequent packets if it needs to be
fragmented and the last packet always including an ``"end":true`` to end
the channel.

The channel is also compatible with `streams <stream.md.rst>`__ such
that an implementation can share the same underlying channel
handler/streaming logic.

.. code:: json

    {
      "c":1,
      "seq":0,
      "type":"thtp",
      "end":true
    }
    BODY: request packet

The response is the same pattern, with the BODY being a response packet,
continuing in subsequent packets if necessary until the ``"end":true``.

.. code:: json

    {
      "c":1,
      "seq":1,
      "end":true
    }
    BODY: response packet
