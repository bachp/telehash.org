``block`` - Lossy Block Transfer
================================

For transferring lossy data with block sizes larger than the default
packet MTU (1400), such as `802.3 Ethernet
Frames <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame>`__.

The ``"type":"block"`` channel is unidirectional, blocks only flow in
one direction, and multiple block channels may be open in either
direction.

The channel open request must not contain any block data and may contain
an attached packet to specify the purpose of the block channel request
(like ``link`` channels). A block channel may be opened in response to
an external request and the sender may begin sending block packets
immediately following the open, or may wait for an answer before
sending.

Sending a Block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every block sent on the channel is assigned a sequential positive
integer id starting from 1 as the value of ``"b":1``, every packet after
the open is required to have a ``b`` value. The block bytes are attached
as the raw ``BODY``.

Any packet received with an older ``b`` is ignored/dropped.

The offset position of the attached bytes in the larger block is set as
``"at":1000`` and defaults to ``0``. The last packet for a block must
contain a ``"done":true``, and if there are any missing bytes in the
block, the whole block is dropped.

To send a short block that fits in one packet it's just:

.. code:: json

    {
      "c":1,
      "b":1,
      "done":true
    }
    BODY: bytes

To break a 1841 byte block into parts it's:

.. code:: json

    {
      "c":1,
      "b":2
    }
    BODY: bytes 0 to 1000

    {
      "c":1,
      "b":2,
      "at":1000,
      "done":true
    }
    BODY: bytes 1001 to 1841
