telehash secure mesh protocol (v3)
==================================

> this is a draft (issues and pull requests welcome), planning for release version in 03/2015

Telehash is a project to create interoperable private mesh networking:

* 100% end-to-end encrypted at all times
* designed to complement and add to existing transport security
* easy to use for developers to encourage wider adoption of privacy
* manages active link state on all connections
* native implementations to each language/platform
* capable of using different transport protocols
* supports bridging and routing privately by default and optionally via a [public DHT](https://github.com/telehash/blockname)
* each endpoint has verifiable unique fingerprint (`hashname`)
* provides native tunneling of TCP/UDP, HTTP, WebSockets, and more
* strict privacy, no content, identity, or metadata is ever revealed to 3rd parties
* designed for compatibility between embedded device, mobile, and web usage
* supports an automatic discovery mode on local networks when available
* [more background](background.md)

The full protocol is a composite of different individual specifications:

* [hashname](hashname.md) - public key fingerprint (address format)
* [lob](lob.md) - length-object-binary, json+binary serialization (packetization)
* [e3x](e3x/README.md) - end-to-end encrypted exchange (wire encoding, crypto)
* [link](link.md) - establishing and maintaining connections betweent two endpoints
* [mesh](mesh.md) - higher level tools to manage multiple links and do local discovery
* [uri](uri.md) - how to encode/decode endpoint info via URIs for out-of-band bootstrapping
* [transports](transports/README.md) - details (encoding, timeouts, discovery, etc) for mapping/supporting different network transports
* [logo](../logo/) - for use to represent telehash support in apps 

### Implementations

Each implementation provides a library API adapted to its platform or language but they all strive to offer similar functionality including handling hashnames, URIs, and packets (lob), higher level interfaces to create a mesh and links within it, and lower level tools for e3x, transports/pipes, managing keys, etc.  Refer to the [implementers guide](guides/implementers.md) for an overview of the typical methods and patterns.

Experimental implementations are being actively developed at:

* [telehash-js](https://github.com/telehash/telehash-js)
* [telehash-c](https://github.com/telehash/telehash-c).
* [gogotelehash](https://github.com/telehash/gogotelehash)
* [python](https://github.com/telehash/e3x-python)
* [c#](https://github.com/telehash/telehash.net)
* [others in progress](https://github.com/telehash)
