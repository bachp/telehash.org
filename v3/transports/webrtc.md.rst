WebRTC Transport
================

    This is currently being implemented experimentally at
    `telehash-webrtc <https://github.com/quartzjer/telehash-webrtc>`__

When telehash is running inside a browser it is very restricted in
forming direct peer-to-peer connections, but if the browser supports
WebRTC it should attempt to use that as a more direct transport.

When an endpoint supports this it includes in it's ``paths`` a
``{"type":"webrtc"}`` to simply flag that it can support receiving a
``"type":"webrtc"`` channel that will serve as the WebRTC signalling
delivery. The channel is unreliable and a new one is opened/sent for
every signal event, with the signal attached as ``"signal":{...}`` in
the JSON.

All packets must be `cloaked <../e3x/cloaking.md.rst>`__ and are sent as
base64 encoded message events over a data channel.

Path JSON
---------

Example `path <../channels/path.md.rst>`__ JSON:

.. code:: json

    {
        "type": "webrtc"
    }
