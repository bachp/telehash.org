802.15.4 - Device/Sensor RF Transports
======================================

There are a number of different transports that use
`802.15.4 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4>`__ framing,
typically for embedded devices and sensor networks.

Due to the nature of the low level RF framing, most of these transports
have similar properties of a <127 byte frame and some minimal built-in
per-frame acking and sequencing (low reliability).

In most cases, `chunking <../lob/chunking.md.rst>`__ can be used to
directly encode a packet to and from a series of frames between devices
over these transports.
