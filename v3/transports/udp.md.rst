UDP Transport
=============

Direct mapping, one packet to one message, always
`cloaked <../e3x/cloaking.md.rst>`__.

Local port binding is dynamic (bind to ``0``) unless given a specific
port. Implementations should support mapping the dynamic port via
NAT-PMP and UPnP when possible.

Packets larger than the MTU may be fragmented by the router, but
`chunking <../lob/chunking.md.rst>`__ should not be used for UDP
messages, packets larger than a low MTU should be dropped so that higher
level implementations can optimize the packet sizes and detect the MTU.

Timeout
-------

A new keepalive handshake should be automatically triggered when no
packets have been sent for 30 seconds in order to keep any NAT mappings
active.

Discovery
---------

UDP transports must always also listen on ``*:42420`` with broadcast
enabled and also join the multicast address group ``239.42.42.42`` when
available.

When discovery is enabled, the announcement packet(s) should be
broadcast to the local LAN subnets port ``42420`` and the multicast
group once every 10 seconds.

Path JSON
---------

Example `path <../channels/path.md.rst>`__ JSON for IPv4:

.. code:: json

    {
        "ip": "192.168.0.55",
        "port": 42424,
        "type": "udp4"
    }

Example `path <../channels/path.md.rst>`__ JSON for IPv6:

.. code:: json

    {
        "ip": "fe80::bae8:56ff:fe43:3de4",
        "port": 42424,
        "type": "udp6"
    }
