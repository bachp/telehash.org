Length-Object-Binary Encoding (Packet Format)
=============================================

This is a simple encoding scheme to combine any JSON object with any
binary data (both are optional) into one byte array, often referred to
as a single ``packet``. This encoding does not include any total packet
size or checksums, and expects the context where it's used to provide
those when necessary (see `chunking <chunking.md.rst>`__).

Implementations
---------------

-  `javascript <https://github.com/quartzjer/lob-enc>`__ (node and
   browserify)
-  `c <https://github.com/telehash/telehash-c/blob/master/src/lib/lob.h>`__

It is common to also support `cloaking <../e3x/cloaking.md.rst>`__
within a LOB library as a convenience.

Definition
----------

The wire-format byte array (a packet) is created by combining three
distinct parts, the ``LENGTH``, an optional ``HEAD``, and an optional
``BODY``.

The ``LENGTH`` is always two bytes which are a network-order short
unsigned integer that represents the number of bytes for the ``HEAD``.
When the ``HEAD`` is greather than 6 bytes then they are always parsed
and represented as a UTF-8 JSON object. Any bytes remaining after the
``HEAD`` are the ``BODY`` and always handled as binary.

The format is thus:

::

    <LENGTH>[HEAD][BODY]

A simplified example of how to decode a packet, written in Node.js:

.. code:: js

    dgram.createSocket("udp4", function(msg){
        var head_length = msg.readUInt16BE(0);
        var head = msg.slice(2, head_length + 2);
        var body_length = msg.length - (head_length + 2);
        var body = msg.slice(head_length + 2, body_length);
        var json = (head_length >= 7) ? JSON.parse(head.toString("utf8")) : undefined;
    });

It is only a parsing error when the ``LENGTH`` is greater than the size
of the packet or when the JSON parsing fails. When successful, parsers
must always return five values:

-  ``HEAD LENGTH`` - 0 to packet length - 2
-  ``HEAD`` - undefined/null or binary
-  ``JSON`` - undefined/null or decoded object
-  ``BODY LENGTH`` - 0 to packet length - (2 + HEAD LENGTH)
-  ``BODY`` - undefined/null or binary

LENGTH / HEAD
-------------

A ``LENGTH`` of 0 means there is no ``HEAD`` included and the packet is
all binary (only ``BODY``).

A ``LENGTH`` of 1-6 means the ``HEAD`` is only binary (no JSON).

A ``LENGTH`` of 7+ means the HEAD must be a UTF-8 encoded JSON object
(not any bare string/bool/number/array value) within the guidelines of
`I-JSON <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-json-i-json/?include_text=1>`__.
If the JSON parsing fails, the parser must return an error.

BODY
----

The optional ``BODY`` is always a raw binary of the remainder bytes
between the packet's total length and that of the ``HEAD``.

Often packets are attached inside other packets as the ``BODY``,
enabling simple packet wrapping/relaying usage patterns.
